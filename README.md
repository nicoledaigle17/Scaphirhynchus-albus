# Scaphirhynchus-albus
This repository contains files for pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus, for the DEB2021 School. This project aims to improve the existing entry for pallid sturgeon, so the existing files (my_data, pars_init, and predict) have been included from the AmP database, in addition to the working document (Data_Scaphirhynchus_Albus_Feb18) to assess the parameters.
