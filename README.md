# Scaphirhynchus-albus
This repository contains files for pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus, for the DEB2021 School. This project aims to expand upon the existing entry for pallid sturgeon, so the existing files (my_data, pars_init, and predict) have been included from the AmP database, in addition to the working Excel file (Data_Scaphirhynchus_Albus_Feb18) to assess the parameters/incorporate new data.
